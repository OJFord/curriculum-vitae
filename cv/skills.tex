In terms of natural languages, I am a native English (BrE) speaker, and learning Hindi (by self-study).

I also enjoy 3D printing functional parts and hobby electronics, so have some familiarity with Fusion360 \& KiCAD. Less relatedly, I enjoy cooking, DIY, making things, and watching others do so on Youtube.
