Professionally my experience is mainly with Python \& Terraform, and I've been known as the 'go-to' person for git help, but I consider them essentially replaceable tools with transferable skills.

In terms of natural languages, I am a native (British) English speaker, and learning Hindi by self-study.

I also enjoy 3D printing functional parts and hobby electronics, so have some familiarity with Fusion360 \& KiCAD, and less relatedly I enjoy cooking, DIY; generally making and repairing things or learning how it's done.
